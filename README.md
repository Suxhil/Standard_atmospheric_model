# Standard_atmospheric_model

This is a simple ISA model written in c++ that calculates the value of pressure, density and temperature as a function of altitude. Compile the code and run. You need to enter the altitude in meters and the output will be for pressure, density and temperature in SI units at that altitude. The limit of calculation is 20000 meters from the sea level.
